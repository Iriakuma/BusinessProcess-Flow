# BusinessProcess-Flow
A process flow is a sequential representation of the steps and decisions involved in a specific business activity. It maps out the stages in a process, typically using flowcharts, to provide a clear understanding of workflow, roles, and responsibilities and identify opportunities for efficiency and improvement.

## Zelle Money Transfer Prcoess Flow
For this project, we will analyze a Zelle transfer process flow from start to finish.
A Zelle transaction is a quick and straightforward process. The sender inputs the recipient's email or phone number into Zelle through their bank's app. Once the recipient's details are verified, funds are instantly transferred from the sender's account to the recipient's. If the recipient isn't already registered with Zelle, they receive a prompt to sign up to access the transferred funds. This process highlights Zelle's efficiency in facilitating immediate peer-to-peer payments.
