# BusinessProcess-Flow
A process flow is a sequential representation of the steps and decisions involved in carrying out a specific business activity. It maps out the different stages in a process, typically using flowcharts, to provide a clear understanding of workflow, roles, and responsibilities, and to identify opportunities for efficiency and improvement.
